        <b>Jambo! </b>I'm Carey, but my friends call me Okal. I'm a
        first-gen undergrad from Kisii, Kenya, studying Information Science at
        Cornell University with a triple
        concentration in Data Science, Networks, Crowds and Markets and Interactive Technologies. <br /><br />
        I have a diverse range of interests that encompass information
        architecture, front-end web development, and web application
        development on both the client and server sides, along with a strong
        focus on search engine optimization. My technical skills include
        Python, Java, shell scripting, and proficiency in front-end technologies
        such as HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript, ReactJS and JQuery.
        Additionally, I have hands-on experience with various Python libraries
        like NumPy, Beautiful Soup, Pandas, Requests, Seaborn, Matplotlib for
        data analysis and visualization, as well as expertise in SQL for
        efficient database management.
        <br /><br />Apart from my studies, I'm an active member of the Under
        Represented Minorities in Computing group on campus. I'm also involved
        in the <a href="https://acfcornell.mystrikingly.com/" target="_blank">Adventist Christian Fellowship.</a> And of
        course, I really enjoy
        cracking jokes and meeting new people.

              As I neared the end of my high school years and began preparing
              for the future, I noticed a significant issue at Darajambili
              Primary school, where I had studied earlier. They were facing a
              shortage of math tutors due to budget constraints, which was
              creating a noticeable gap in the students' education. Driven by
              a strong desire to contribute, I decided to take action. Instead
              of being idle, I dedicated my weekends to volunteer as a math
              tutor for these students. My approach was patient and
              passionate. <br /><br />
              I focused on making math concepts more accessible and
              understandable. The results were evident after each session. The
              students' comprehension of math visibly improved, and their
              grades began to rise. For me, this experience was more than just
              teaching mathematics; it was about instilling confidence and a
              love for learning in these young minds.

              I created a hotel management system using Visual Basic for
              Applications for Ufanisi Resort in Kisii. This system
              streamlines guest bookings, report generation, and inventory
              management for the hotel. In addition, I added advanced data
              analysis capabilities to help Ufanisi Resort make smarter
              decisions. The system also features a user-friendly interface I
              designed for easy navigation and efficient use of its functions.

              In response to our community's struggles with insecurity and
              unemployment, I started "Vijana na Computer." Our goal is simple
              but vital: give local youth a boost by teaching them how to
              code. As the founder and lead instructor, my job was to steer a
              small, eager group of 10 students into the exciting realm of web
              development. <br /><br />This adventure meant diving into CSS,
              HTML5, and the ever-changing world of JavaScript. But it wasn't
              just about coding. I also shared handy tips on tools like
              Twitter Bootstrap, how to showcase projects on GitHub, and the
              tricks to make a website more noticeable on search engines
              (that's SEO for you!). Teaching these skills was part of a
              bigger picture – to give a comprehensive education. It's been an
              amazing journey guiding these incredible young minds.
